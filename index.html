<p> style="font-family:verdana;" What do you percieve as you walk? Where is your consciense as you navigate London? Different minds are atunned to different layers of perception.
  A photographer may walk around conscient of framing his vision. A aritst might look for strong shadows. An architect might be nmore conscious of 
  the frontage of buildings. <a href="https://isobelrbinnie.github.io/ITERATIONSOFLONDON/submissionform.html ">Help us see London through your eyes.</a>
